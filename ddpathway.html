  <p>ICDM Director Development Pathway is a series of Director Programmes specifically developed in accordance to best
    practices in corporate governance, director competencies and technical know-how required regardless of company size
    and industry.</p>
  <p>ICDM&rsquo;s public programmes are open to members and non-members, and we also cater to bespoke programmes to suit
    specific organisational needs. Check out our 2022 Public Programme Calendar <span style="color: #1aa9e1;"><a
        style="color: #1aa9e1;" href="https://pulse.icdm.com.my/director-programmes/" target="_blank"
        rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a></span>.</p>
  <p>By joining our public programmes, a director is given the opportunity to meet a diverse background of peers from
    various industries and expertise. This will help them to gain fresh insights, perspectives and real-world knowledge
    in situations where it is not easily obtained within the boardroom.</p>

        Depending on the programme and module, one week before the facilitated session, pre-reading time is provided for
        participants to review the programme materials and go through the case studies. <br><br>

        Selected sessions will provide at least one breakout discussion, based on the pre-reading materials for a more
        enriching deliberation and reflective discussion.

        Thought leadership is an integral part of ICDM directors programme. In response to new requirements, standards,
        frameworks and regulations requirements for business – a panel discussion format can potentially draw out
        diverse insights from each speaker, provide new perspectives and encourage exchanges amongst panelists, as well
        as the audience.<br><br>

        This format is best suited for commentary talks, advisory dialogues and specialised topics conferences.

        Learning experience should not just be one way. A facilitator’s role is to guide and lead the discussion based
        on the programme outline, curriculum and learning outcomes, as well as expectations.<br><br>

        We provide space for participants to share-discuss-identify the best approach to specific issues. The format
        also allows for greater interaction between board and management to productively engage and work towards a
        common and aligned goal, especially in the areas of strategy & growth.
