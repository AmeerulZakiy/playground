<span style="color: #24255d;">How many times have you heard</span> a variation of “<span style="color: #19aae1;"><a
        style="color: #19aae1;"
        href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/seven-lessons-on-how-technology-transformations-can-deliver-value">Business
        and IT</a></span> need to work better together”? That piece of advice contains one of the most important shifts
companies can make to establish a technology capability that enables them to compete effectively in the digital age.

Some companies have made changes, such as giving product managers new product-owner roles. But without sufficient
training or changes to team dynamics, those shifts often remain superficial and don’t improve team performance. Too many
companies are still too quick to point the finger at IT for every technical woe, from development delays to cost
overruns. Casting IT as scapegoat can be a hard habit to change.

That’s not to say there isn’t plenty of room for improvement on the IT side of the house. Efforts to <span

        up tech talent</a></span>—all require significant improvements in how IT works and where it sets its priorities.
But in a time when the technology capability is a source of competitive advantage, why doesn’t that happen more often?

There are many reasons, but the solution comes down to something that’s deceptively simple: if IT is to become a real
driver of value, both business and IT must overcome bad habits and make a real commitment to being partners. That
implies adoption on both sides of processes, mindsets, and capabilities that reinforce the mechanisms that nurture
habits that can improve technology performance.
<h2><span style="color: #19aae1;">The Trouble With Go-Betweens: Accountability</span></h2>
Because technology can seem confusing, opaque, or intimidating, those on the business side prefer to leave it to the IT
experts. To bridge the disconnect, companies have turned to dedicated “go-between” roles as part of a well-meaning
effort to make IT more responsive and customer oriented. Individuals variously designated as “translators,” “demand IT,”
“business requirement managers,” or “IT process managers” take business requests and turn them into clear requirements
with instructions for workers on the IT side, many of whom work offshore.

Unfortunately, the effect of these roles is often reduced accountability on both sides of the divide. On the business
side, managers are content to define requirements without understanding how technology can best deliver on them and to,
in effect, wash their hands of the whole IT development process. On the IT side, translators often simply accept
requests from the business side without understanding the core issue, so they don’t think through the whole range of
possible technology solutions. Even when the go-betweens speak for business needs and even report to or sit on the
business side of the organization, they are seldom evaluated in terms of their P&amp;L results. Meanwhile, the addition
of an intermediary layer between business and IT slows time to market, which impedes <span style="color: #19aae1;"><a
        style="color: #19aae1;"
        href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/the-new-digital-edge-rethinking-strategy-for-the-postpandemic-era">digital
        efforts to accelerate the pace of business practices</a></span>.
<h2><span style="color: #19aae1;">The Four Levels of Business–IT Integration</span></h2>
The ultimate goal is to connect the top-level business strategy defined at the boaFrd level to technical implementation
in IT. That means negotiating four levels, and business needs to be knowledgeable about, and involved in, all of them:
<ul>
    <li>top management/board level</li>
    <li>business process implementation</li>
    <li>IT governance</li>
    <li>technology platform</li>
</ul>
Each of these four levels can accelerate or slow down the development of new internal or external functionalities for
the customer. But for the entire model to work effectively, it is important that the levels are aligned in their degree
of maturity; being strong in one area and weak in another doesn’t work well.

<!-- >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> LEVEL 1 <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<< -->

<h3><span style="color: #24255d;">Level 1: Top Management/Board Level</span></h3>
The measure of something’s importance to an organization is the seriousness with which it is addressed at the top levels
of leadership. That means both the C-suite and the board should have technology as a top priority on their agendas.
Without that, the business will have a difficult time making the decisions and investments needed to modernize and scale
technology.

There are two actions top management can take to demonstrate their commitment to IT:
<ul>
    <li style="padding-bottom: 16px;"><em><span style="color: #0000ff;">
                <p> Prioritize IT at the C-suite level.
            </span></em><span style="color: #0000ff;"> </span>Business attitudes and behaviors toward IT won’t shift
        unless business leaders—the CEO and CFO in particular—get personally involved. This personal commitment is
        necessary because, even when there is a high-level acknowledgement that digital and technology are important to
        the board, the actual time and energy spent on them often don’t reflect a real commitment on the business side.
        </p>
        <span style="color: #ff00ff; "><span style="color: #ff00ff; ">&lt;&gt;</span></span>
        <p>At one large consumer company, for
            example, an effort to modernize enterprise resource planning (ERP) failed when it was treated as purely an
            IT
            project. That’s because many of the issues that affected the ERP system, such as the warehouse structure,
            fell
            outside the scope of the IT department. The modernization effort was therefore complex and costly to
            maintain.
            To redress these issues, leadership made ERP the subject of board-level discussions and ensured that the
            business and IT sides worked on it together. This created shared accountability and incentives. Top
            management
            focused on changes to both the IT systems and the business architecture, such as how the warehouses are set
            up.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p><em><span style="color: #0000ff;">Understand how IT decisions affect the business.</span></em> In quite a few
            companies, the lack of business involvement with technology stems from discomfort in the board or C-suite
            with
            IT topics. The result is that technology is deprioritized and seldom discussed.Decision makers on the
            business
            side need a good basic understanding of technology. They don’t need to know how to write code, but they do
            need
            to understand what different technologies do. When one CEO decided to give IT a more prominent role in his
            organization, he sent his whole top-management team to technology training courses. His rationale was that
            learning about how cloud works and how systems depend on each other would enable them to make more educated
            decisions for the business on IT matters. This training was also widely reported in the company, sending a
            strong signal to the entire organization that technology savviness was important. (Read more about how <span
                style="color: #19aae1;"><a style="color: #19aae1;"
                    href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/people-and-organizational-performance/our-insights/the-four-building-blocks--of-change">leaders
                    can model change</a></span>.)</p>


        <p><span style="color: #ff00ff;">&lt;&gt;</span>This deeper understanding of
            IT provides the foundation for business leaders to make a more profound mindset shift: a willingness to
            engage
            in detailed conversations with IT to better understand the implications of technology decisions and dig into
            technology-related root-cause issues where necessary.</p>


        <span style="color: #ff00ff;">&lt;&gt;</span>
        <p> Take, for
            example, the latency behavior of integrations in an enterprise service bus (ESB). This is a highly technical
            issue, but poor execution can cause delays that affect a website’s performance, which makes it a business
            issue
            as well. In this case, business leaders need to be able to understand the latency issues around ESB
            integration
            and work with IT to reduce them.</p>

        <span style="color: #ff00ff;">&lt;&gt;</span>

        <p>This same level of understanding
            is also required by the IT side. IT has to be aware of business realities when developing IT solutions. A
            handheld device developed in a warm office, for example, will likely fail if its primary business use case
            is in
            cold weather.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="color: #24255d;">Level 2: Business Process Implementation</span></h3>
When the board makes a tech-related decision, it is primarily up to the business to translate it into a business process
that can be implemented. That requires the business to work with IT to set KPIs, put together the right teams, and
develop strategic road maps. Business stakeholders need to build specific capabilities and shift mindsets across the
following dimensions:
<ul>
    <li style="padding-bottom: 16px;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><em>Empower your product
                managers.</em></span> Empowered and knowledgeable<span style="color: #19aae1;"> <a
                style="color: #19aae1;"
                href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/technology-media-and-telecommunications/our-insights/what-separates-top-product-managers-from-the-rest-of-the-pack">product
                managers</a></span> (or product owners) with the autonomy to direct their teams toward specific goals is
        one of the most important factors in a tech-forward organization. A good product manager combines both business
        and technology skills with the operational skills to effectively lead teams. <span
            style="color: #ff00ff;">&lt;&gt;</span> The lack of delegated decision rights is one of the major issues
        that can defang an effective agile operating model. In many cases, the issue is that there is a “proxy” product
        manager within IT. While this person might be formally qualified as a product manager, he or she usually doesn’t
        have the mandate to really change the business side’s processes and approach.</li>
    <li style="padding-bottom: 16px;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><em>Make tech competency a career
                necessity.</em></span> It’s often considered a bad career move when a business-side person moves to work
        on an IT initiative. One company handpicked people from the business side to lead a large-scale program that the
        CEO had acclaimed as a huge opportunity, only to find that the few people selected to help lead the program
        turned it down because it was in IT. <span style="color: #ff00ff;">&lt;&gt;</span>Business leaders need to flip
        the view of working with IT from career killer to career builder. One way to do that is to ensure that employee
        career planning includes a technology element—for example, through structured rotational and exchange programs
        in which business managers work with IT. <span style="color: #ff00ff;">&lt;&gt;</span> In the same vein, tech
        knowledge and experience should become a necessity for anyone wanting to move ahead, regardless of role.
        Incorporating technology modules into learning journeys, for example, can help ensure people on the business
        side continue to build up their technical knowledge. This can include, for example, helping business people to
        use <span style="color: #19aae1;"><a style="color: #19aae1;"
                href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/tech-forward/low-code-no-code-a-way-to-transform-shadow-it-into-a-next-gen-technology-asset">low
                code/no code tools</a></span>, harness emerging <span style="color: #19aae1;"><a style="color: #19aae1;"

                AI tools</a></span> to help with specific tasks, assess vendors, and analyze data. <span
            style="color: #ff00ff;">&lt;&gt;</span> Classic role modeling is also important. When prominent business
        leaders drive IT initiatives, it signals to the company that IT is important. At a major retailer, for example,
        the former CFO of a country led a major IT transformation program. Similarly, a large data-governance and
        data-architecture initiative at a major CPG company was led by the CFO of one of its main divisions.</li>
    <li style="padding-bottom: 16px;"><em><span style="color: #0000ff;">Co-lead instead of “partnering.</span>”</em>
        Despite best efforts to get business and IT collaborating more effectively, companies still often end up with a
        culture clash where the two sides still see each other as adversaries. That can be fixed only through
        fundamental changes in incentives, processes, and operations. <span style="color: #ff00ff;">&lt;&gt;</span> In
        our experience, it can be helpful to treat business–IT collaboration like post merger management, which provides
        for a more systematic approach to tackling cultural and logistics disconnects that keep teams from working
        together. Aligning incentives for both the business and IT is often a good place to start. Similarly, a focus on
        culture building needs to be supported with incentives such as relevant business units contributing the budget
        and nominating a senior leader to act as the product owner for joint business–IT solutions.</li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="color: #24255d;">Level 3: IT Governance</span></h3>
An effective operating model has a defined business process and the technology capability to deliver it. An operating
model, however, is only as successful as its ability to incorporate the business side through effective governance
practices. Following are a few proven steps:
<ul>
    <li style="padding-bottom: 16px;"><em><span style="color: #0000ff;">Translating IT decisions into joint business
                objectives</span>.</em> In most companies, IT has a budget cap based on the average industry spend, and
        that cap rarely moves. However, if tech initiatives are expressed in terms of a clear ROI, the CFO can more
        easily judge whether developing a new application is a better investment than, say, opening a new store. <span
            style="color: #ff00ff;">&lt;&gt;</span> One area where looking at IT through a financial lens can be
        particularly helpful is in managing <span style="color: #19aae1;"><a style="color: #19aae1;"
                href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/demystifying-digital-dark-matter-a-new-standard-to-tame-technical-debt">tech
                debt</a> </span>(the cost of dealing with legacy issues when developing new tech products or services).
        CIOs estimate that <span style="color: #19aae1;"><a style="color: #19aae1;"
                href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/tech-debt-reclaiming-tech-equity">tech
                debt amounts to 20 to 40 percent of the value of their entire technology estate</a></span> before
        depreciation. Yet companies seldom know the cost of tech debt for a given initiative or factor it into the work
        they do. IT can help the business understand the cost of tech debt by pricing it into all IT projects. <span
            style="color: #ff00ff;">&lt;&gt;</span> Ideally, the cross-functional team has joint objectives and key
        results (OKRs) that reflect the business and the IT objectives of the respective area.</li>
    <li style="padding-bottom: 16px;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><em>Communicating in business terms.</em></span> IT
        people need to understand what’s important to the business—value, ROI, cost, customer experience—and to be able
        to explain IT’s contribution in those terms. This should be an exercise not in dumbing down IT for the
        uninitiated but in clearly articulating the implications of technology for the business. That means not only
        describing the immediate benefits (such as higher conversion in a particular step of the checkout funnel) but
        also the full monetary value—in this case, the EBIT impact of the improved conversion rate.</li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="color: #24255d;">Level 4: Technology Platform</span></h3>
When it comes down to actually developing technology products and services, companies need to navigate a lot of
buzzwords (DevOps, DevSecOps, agile, CI/CD). In essence, these are processes that all encourage closer collaboration at
the operational level to reduce waste and accelerate time to market. While it’s not realistic for the business to be
involved at the coding level, understanding how supporting systems can impact development is critical to helping
prioritize investments and resources, particularly in two areas:
<ul>
    <li style="padding-bottom: 16px;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><em>Digital platform.</em></span> When developing
        new functionality, IT teams often spend the first weeks or sometimes even months of a project deciding what
        tools to use and tapping other IT teams for additional functionalities they have developed. A “digital platform”
        can reduce that wasted time by providing teams with a more user-friendly, “batteries included” standard set of
        tools and processes to test and deploy new functionality. It also includes up-to-date documentation on how to
        get functionality and data from other teams through APIs. This accelerates the development of new systems and
        the reuse of existing functionality.</li>
    <li style="padding-bottom: 16px;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><em>Automating IT systems.</em></span> Automation
        has made major strides in IT, but significant issues exist. Compiling the software and distributing it is often
        automated. But what about testing? Are architecture rules and regulations tested automatically as part of the
        deployment, or are they available only on paper or an intranet website? Business and IT should not view
        automation as a capability they apply only in certain places; it needs to be a core feature of how IT runs.</li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="color: #19aae1;">Going Forward: Ensuring Consistency Across Levels</span></h2>
Effectively bridging the gap between business and IT requires alignment across the four levels outlined above. This
interdependency is why it’s much more important that all the elements reach similar levels of maturity than to have a
few that perform well and a few that perform poorly. This is the classic “weakest link” principle, where weakness in one
area is sufficient to undo the whole (exhibit).
